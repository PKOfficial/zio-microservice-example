# ZIO MicroService Example

This is an example showing how to create a microservice using ZIO with Scala. This is a very basic example of a microservice which communicate through HTTP Endpoints, store data in Postgres using Doobie, manage configuration using ZIO Config and HOCON, log and tracing using ZIO-Logging and managing metrics using ZIO-Metrics. For HTTP endpoints I have used ZIO HTTP which is easy to use and as mentioned in their benchmarks is quite performant.
